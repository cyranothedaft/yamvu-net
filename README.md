# yamvu-net - (yet another) MVU Framework, for .NET

Made from scratch using only the freshest organic ingredients (blood, sweat, tears) and huge amounts of research, trial, and error.

## Consists of three libraries (currently):

- ### yamvu

  The main MVU library; mainly it contains the program "runners".

  _Targets .NET 8.0_.

- ### yamvu.Core

  Core MVU types and abstractions.

  _Targets .NET 8.0_.

- ### yamvu.Testing

  Utilities to aid with automated testing / unit tests.

  _Targets .NET 8.0_.

_This is Work in progress. It is probably not for everyone._

> Many thanks to those who have written about or created existing MVU platforms, concepts, and related ideas. I'm keeping track and will list those acknowledgements here.
