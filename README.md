# yamvu-net - (yet another) MVU Framework, for .NET

Made from scratch using only the freshest organic ingredients (blood, sweat, tears) and huge amounts of research, trial, and error.

_This is Work in progress. It is probably not for everyone._

> Many thanks to those who have written about or created existing MVU platforms, concepts, and related ideas. I'm keeping track and will list those acknowledgements here.
