# yamvu-net - (yet another) MVU Framework, for .NET

Made from scratch using only the freshest organic ingredients (blood, sweat, tears) and huge amounts of research, trial, and error.

## Consists of three libraries (currently):

- ### yamvu 

  The main MVU library; mainly it contains the program "runners".

  _Targets .NET 8.0_.

  https://www.nuget.org/packages/yamvu/

  `dotnet add package yamvu --version 0.2.0-beta`

- ### yamvu.Core

  Core MVU types and abstractions.

  _Targets .NET 8.0_.

  https://www.nuget.org/packages/yamvu.Core/

  `dotnet add package yamvu.Core --version 0.2.0-beta`

- ### yamvu.Testing

  Utilities to aid with automated testing / unit tests.

  _Targets .NET 8.0_.

  https://www.nuget.org/packages/yamvu.Testing/

  `dotnet add package yamvu.Testing --version 0.2.0-beta`



_This is Work in progress. It is probably not for everyone._

> Many thanks to those who have written about or created existing MVU platforms, concepts, and related ideas. I'm keeping track and will list those acknowledgements here.
